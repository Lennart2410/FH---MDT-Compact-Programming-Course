*All Getter and Setter are represented by <<get>> or <<set>> in order to keep the UML-Diagram structured.

** Abstract classes and methods are represented by {abstract} instead of just being italic for visibility purpose.

### Project Requirements - Amazon Fulfillment Center

The Homework Assignments and Capstone Project have a shared project idea. The project is the Amazon Fulfillment center,
which is a real life adaption of the warehouse systems from the Self assignments. The warehouse processes cover the
general processes which an order goes through before it is delivered to a customer. The warehouse itself is divided into
four different stations, which cover the core functionality in the process of ordering products.
After the placement of the order, each order goes through every station one after another.

#### Picking station

The picking station is the first station at which the order is being handled. There, the different items are being
picked from inventory shelves so that the items can be transported to the next station.

#### AGV runner

The AGV runner itself is not a real station, but shares key points with the other stations. The AGV runner is a
self-driving robot which can carry a load of different items. The main goal is to transport the items of an order to the
next station. Precisely, it transports items from the Picking station to the Packing station or from the Packing station
to the Loading station.

#### Packing station

The Packing station receives the items from the AGV runner, which have to be wrapped up into a box. The box size is
automatically calculated based on the weight of the items. The wrapped up items are afterward handed over to the AGV
runner that will transport the parcels to the Loading station.

#### Loading station

The Loading station is the final part inside the warehouse system. It takes the parcels and puts them into delivery
vehicles based up on weight of the parcels and their destination. Two kind of employees work at the Loading station.
Loader employees fill up the delivery vehicles with parcels and make them ready to be delivered. Driver employees take
care of delivering the loaded parcels to the customer.
